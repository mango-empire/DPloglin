Description: Tools for conducting privacy-aware Bayesian inference. The `dapper_sample()`
             function takes an existing sampler as input and automatically constructs
             a privacy-aware sampler. The process of constructing a sampler is simplified 
             through the specification of four independent modules, allowing for
             easy comparison between different privacy mechanisms by only swapping
             out the relevant modules. Probability mass functions
             for the discrete Gaussian and discrete Laplacian are provided to facilitate
             analyses dealing with privatized count data. The output of `dapper_sample`
             fits easily within existing Bayesian workflows since draws
             are stored in `draw_matrix` format.
